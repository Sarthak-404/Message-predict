# Chat Message Predictor
This project is a simple Streamlit application that predicts the next chat message based on the current time, location, and the previous message. It utilizes a BERT model for sequence classification to generate predictions.

## Overview
The Chat Message Predictor application allows users to input:

- The current time
- The current location (e.g., home, office, traveling)
- The previous message

Based on these inputs, the application predicts the next likely message. This is useful for demonstrating the capabilities of machine learning in predicting text based on context.

## Features
* **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
* **BERT Model**: A pre-trained BERT model for text prediction is used.
* **Real-time Prediction**: Provides instant predictions based on user inputs.
